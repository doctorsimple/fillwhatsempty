Nameless, it is the source of the thousands of things (named, it is 'Mother' of the thousands of things). 
Yes: Always: being desireless, one sees the hidden essentials. Always: having desires, one sees only what is sought. 
These two lines are about The Merging - it is when things develop and emerge from this that the different names appear. 
The Merging is something mysterious - mysterious, and more mysterious, the abode of all the hidden essences.

'the noble' and 'the lowly' give content to one another the music and the voice harmonize with one another the back and the front follow one another. Always. 
And so the Wise Person: Settles into his job of Not Doing carries on his teaching done without talking. 
The thousands of things arise and are active - and he rejects none of them. 
He is a doer but does not rely on this he achieves successes but does not dwell in them. He just does not dwell in them, and so they cannot be taken away.

Not prizing goods hard to come by brings it about that the people do not become thieves 
Not paying attention to the desirable brings it about that the people's minds do not become disordered. 
And so, the government of the Wise Person: Empty their minds, fill their bellies weaken their ambitions, strengthen their bones. 
Always bring it about that the people are without knowledge and without desires. Bring it about that the clever ones do not presume to set about doing. 
Do Not Doing and nothing will be left un-governed.

What enables Heaven and Earth to last and endure? Because they do not live for themselves - so it is that they can live so long. 
And so, the Wise Person: Puts himself last, and so finds himself in front. 
puts himself in the out group, and so maintains his place. 
The personal does not exist for him - isn't this how he can perfect what for him is most personal? 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">8.</span><span class="ttctext">The highest Excellence is like water. Water, Excellent at being of benefit to the thousands of things, does not contend - it settles in places everyone else avoids. Yes, it is just about Tao. 
Excellence in a house: the ground "Excellence in a mind: depth Excellence in companions: Goodness Excellence in speaking: sincerity 
Excellence in setting things right: good management Excellence on the job: ability Excellence in making a move: good timing." 
Simply do not contend then there will be no fault.

What does it mean, "high rank does great damage to your self"? What is the source of the great damage done me? It is because I have a self If I had no self what damage could be done me? This is what it means, "high rank does great damage to your self." 
Yes: A valuing of one's self that regards the self the same as the world - this means one can be entrusted with the world. A loving of one's self that regards the self the same as the world - this means one can be given the world.

Its top is not bright Its underside is not dim. Always unnameable, It turns back to nothingness. 
This is the shape of something shapeless the form of a nothing this is elusive and evasive. Encountering It, you won't see the front following It, you won't see Its back. 
Keep to the Tao of the ancients and so manage things happening today. The ability to know the ancient sources, this is the main thread of Tao. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">15.</span><span class="ttctext">The Excellent shih of ancient times penetrated into the most obscure, the marvelous, the mysterious. They had a depth beyond understanding.

yielding, like ice about to melt unspecified, like the Uncarved Block all vacant space, like the Valley everything mixed together, like muddy water. 
Who is able, as muddy water, by Stilling to slowly become clear? Who is able, at rest, by long drawn-out movement to slowly come to life? 
Whoever holds onto this Tao does not yearn for solidity. He simply lacks solidity, and so what he is capable of: Remaining concealed, accomplishing nothing new. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">16.</span><span class="ttctext">Push Emptiness to the limit, watch over Stillness very firmly. 
The thousands of things all around are active - I give my attention to Turning Back. Things growing wild as weeds all turn back to the Root. 
To turn back to The Root is called Stillness. This is 'reporting in' 'reporting in' is becoming Steady. Experiencing Steadiness is Clarity. Not to experience Steadiness is to be heedless in one's actions - bad luck. 
Experiencing Steadiness, then one is all-embracing all-embracing, then an impartial Prince Prince, then King King, then Heaven Heaven, then Tao

"All the others are beaming and beaming like people enjoying a great ceremonial feast, like people climbing an overlook tower in the spring. I am alone still - no indications at all yet like an infant who hasn't yet even smiled. So sad. Like someone with no place to go home to. 
All the others have a superabundance I alone seem to have missed out. Oh my simpleton's mind! So confused.

Tao is a something but elusive, but evasive. Evasive, elusive, inside it lies the mind's true form. Elusive, evasive, inside it lies something substantial. Shadowy, dim. Inside it lies vital energy. This energy is very strong inside it lies true genuineness. 
From ancient times until today Its name has not been forgotten allowing us to see the beginnings of everything. 
How do I recognize the form of the beginnings of everything? By this low in the cycle of Change, which is Love and Beauty. How do I know this? By my comprehension of the Dao.

He does not show off, so he shines he does not promote himself, so he becomes famous he does not boast of himself, so he gets the credit he does not glorify himself, so he becomes leader. 
He just does not contend and so no one can contend with him.

One who merges with Tao, Tao welcomes him one who merges with Te, Te welcomes him one who merges with What Is Left Out, What Is Left Out welcomes him.

Great means going forth going forth means going far away going far away means turning back.

Light, then lose the Root agitated, then lose the mastery.

The Excellent person is the teacher of the person who is not Excellent. The person who is not Excellent is material for the Excellent person. 
Not to treasure one's teacher not to love one's material, though 'smart,' is a great mistake. This is an important secret.

Weapons are ill-omened instruments not instruments for the gentleman he uses them when he has no choice. What is calm and quiet is highest. 
When victorious, he does not think this a fine thing because to think it fine is to delight in slaughtering people. One who delights in slaughtering people cannot achieve his purposes in the world. 
"In fortunate times, prefer the left in mourning, prefer the right." The lower officer takes his stand on the left the higher officer takes his stand on the right. This says: He takes his stand as at a mourning ceremony. 
At the slaughter of such masses of men, he weeps for them, mourning and lamenting. When victorious in the battle - he takes his stand as at a mourning ceremony.

Open your eyes carry on your business, till the end of your life you will not be safe. 
Keeping your eyes on the Small Thing is called Clarity watching over Weakness is called strength. 
Engage with the flashing things turn back to Clarity do not deliver yourself to disaster. This is cultivating Steadiness. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">53.</span><span class="ttctext">If I had the least bit of understanding I would walk on the great Way. Only display will be dangerous. 
The great Way is very smooth but people love bypaths. 
The court is very well kept the fields are very weedy the granaries very empty. 
"Their clothes are fine and colourful on their belts are sharp swords, they are filled with food and drink" a superabundance of expensive goods. This is robbers boasting, certainly not the Way. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">54.</span><span class="ttctext">Excellently founded: it will not be uprooted Excellently embraced and cared for: it will not slip away so sons and grandsons will never cease to offer the sacrifices. 
Cultivate It in your person, its Te will be pure cultivate It in the clan, its Te will be abundant cultivate It in the village, its Te will be lasting cultivate It in the state, its Te will be ample cultivate It in the empire, its Te will be all-embracing. 
Yes: Judge a person taking that person as the measure judge a clan taking that clan as the measure judge a village taking that village as the measure judge a state taking that state as the measure judge the world taking the world as the measure. 
How do I know the nature of the world? By this. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">55.</span><span class="ttctext">One who has an abundance of Te is like a newborn child: Poisonous bugs will not bite it fierce beasts will not snatch it birds of prey will not attack it. Its bones are Soft, its sinews Weak, but its grip is firm. 
It has not known the union of man and woman, but its organs get aroused: Vital energy at its height. 
It will scream all day without getting hoarse: Harmony at its height. To experience Harmony is called being Steady to experience Steadiness is called Clarity. 
'Increasing life': ominous 'the mind controlling the ch'i': forcing. 
Things are vigorous, then grow old: A case of 'not-Tao'. Not-Tao, soon gone. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">56.</span><span class="ttctext">Those who understand are not talkers talkers don't understand. 
Close your eyes shut your doors. Dampen the passion untie the tangles make the flashing things harmonious make the dust merge together. This is called the mysterious Merging. 
Yes: You cannot get close you cannot stay away you cannot help It you cannot harm It you cannot treasure It you cannot look down on It. Yes: It is the Treasure of the World. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">57.</span><span class="ttctext">"Rule the kingdom by the norm wage war by the unexpected." Take over the world by Not Working. How do I know it is so? By this. 
In the world: The more rules and restrictions there are the poorer the people will be. The people: The more 'sharp weapons' they have, the more disordered the state and the clans will be. 
Men: The more clever and skillful they are, the more weird things will start to happen. The more you publicize rules and laws, the more robbers and thieves you will have. 
Yes, the Wise Person says: I Do Nothing, and the people transform themselves. I love Stillness, and the people bring themselves to correctness. 
I do No Work, and the people enrich themselves. I have no desires, and the people by themselves become Simple. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">58.</span><span class="ttctext">When the ruler is dull and incompetent, the people are pure and simple. When the ruler is sharp and alert, the people are a bad lot. 
"Bad luck: good luck depends on it good luck: bad luck hides in it." 
Who knows where this ends? There is no norm. What accords with the norm turns around and becomes weird what is excellent turns around and becomes ominous. "People's blindness - it has been going on so long now." 
And so the Wise Person: Is square and honest but does not cut is pointed and exact but does not hurt is straight and direct but not tactless shines but does not dazzle. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">59.</span><span class="ttctext">"When it comes to governing the people and serving Heaven there's no one like a farmer." 
Just being a farmer - this means getting dressed early. Getting dressed early means increasing one's store of Te increasing one's store of Te, then nothing is impossible nothing impossible, then no telling the limit no telling the limit, then one can possess the state. 
One who possesses the Mother of the state can last a long time. 
This means having deep roots and strong foundations, the Way of 'lasting life, good eyesight into old age'. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">60.</span><span class="ttctext">Governing a large state is like cooking a small fish. 
Rule the world by Tao then ghosts will not take to haunting. 
It is not that the ghosts will not haunt their haunting will cause no hurt to humankind. (It's not only that their haunting will not hurt humankind, the Wise Person also does not cause hurt to them. 
These two do not hurt each other.) Yes, Te unifies and restores. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">61.</span><span class="ttctext">The great state is a low and easy woman for the world the one the Whole world unites with. Femininity always overcomes Masculinity, by Stillness, in Stillness it takes the low place. 
Yes: A great state, by putting itself lower than the smaller state, will win out over the smaller state. A small state, by putting itself lower than the great state, will win out over the great state. 
Yes: One puts itself lower so it will win out, if the other gets lower, then it will win. 
(A great state has no further desire than to embrace and protect other states. A small state has no further desire than to enter and serve other states. 
So both get what they want) The greatest should be the lowest. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">62.</span><span class="ttctext">Tao is the honoured center for the thousands of things. The treasure of the good what protects the not good. 
Elegant words can buy and sell fine conduct gets people promoted. People who are not good, why are they rejected? 
Yes: When they are enthroning the Son of Heaven or installing the Three Ministers - although they are presenting in tribute jade medallions out in front of four-horse teams, this cannot compare to sitting and setting forth this Tao. 
What was the reason that the ancients treasured this Tao? is it not said: "By it the seeker obtains by it the guilty escapes." Yes: It is the Treasure of the World. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">63.</span><span class="ttctext">Be a Non Doer work at Not Working acquire a taste for that which has no taste. 
Treat small things as though they were great treat few things as though they were many. "Reward what is injurious, with kind Te." 
Plan difficult things focussing on the easy parts do great things focussing on the small details. 
Difficult tasks in the world always begin from what is easy great tasks in the world always begin from what is small. 
And so the Wise Person: Does not 'do great things' and so is able to fulfill his greatness. 
Yes: Light agreement is never very trustworthy considering everything easy makes everything difficult. 
And so the Wise Person: Treats things as difficult, and in the end has no difficulty. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">64.</span><span class="ttctext">When sitting still, they are easy to hold down no omens yet, it is easy to plan when fragile, they are easy to break when small, they are easy to scatter. 
Work on it when it isn't yet put it in order when it is not yet disordered. 
A tree you can barely get your arms around, grows from a tiny shoot a nine-story tower begins as a heap of earth a thousand-mile journey begins under your feet. 
Working ruins, grasping loses. And so the Wise Person: Does not work, so does not ruin does not grasp, so does not lose. 
Men often ruin their affairs on the eve of success, because they are not as prudent at the end as in the beginning. The wise man wills what others do not will, and values not things rare. He learns what others learn not, and gathers up what they despise. 
And so the Wise Person: Desires to be desireless does not prize goods hard to come by learns to be un-leaned turns back to the place all others have gone on from. So as to help along the naturalness of the thousands of things with out presuming to be a Worker. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">65.</span><span class="ttctext">Those Excellent at doing Tao in ancient times - it was not to enlighten the people, but to keep them stupid. 
The difficulty in governing the people - because of their knowledge. Yes: By "Knowledge!" govern the state - a crime against the state. By "Ignorance!" govern the state - a boon to the state. 
Always: To understand these two lines, is also to understand the Ideal Pattern. Always: To understand the Ideal Pattern, is to have mysterious Te. 
Mysterious Te is deep, far-reaching, in opposition to things - only afterward comes the Great Harmony. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">66.</span><span class="ttctext">The Yang-tze and the ocean: How are they able to be Kings of the hundred streams? Because they excel at being low - this is how they are able to be Kings of the hundred streams. 
And so: Wishing to be high above the people, you must by your speech put yourself at the bottom Wishing to be out in front of the people, you must put your self in the last place. 
And so, the Wise Person: Stands above, but the people are not weighed down stands out in front, but the people are not harmed and so the world delights in praising him, and does not tire. 
Because of his not contending no one in the world can contend with him. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">67.</span><span class="ttctext">Everyone in the world says of me: 'great - but doesn't seem normal.' It's just 'greatness' - that's why it does not seem normal. If I were normal, I'd have been of little worth for a long time now. 
I have three treasures, I protect and keep hold of them. The first is called 'gentleness' the second is called 'frugality' the third is called 'not presuming to act like leader of the world.' 
Gentle, so able to be bold frugal, so able to be lavish not presuming to act like leader of the world, so able to become head of a government. 
Now: To be bold without being gentle to be lavish without being frugal to act like leader without putting oneself last: This is death. 
Yes, gentleness: "Attack with it and you will win defend with it and you will stand firm." When Heaven wants to rescue someone, it surrounds him with a wall of gentleness. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">68.</span><span class="ttctext">The best soldier is not warlike the best fighter shows no anger 
the one best at defeating the enemy does not engage him the one best at managing people puts himself below them. 
This is the Te of not contending this is the power to manage people. This is being the Counterpart of Heaven equalling the very best of the ancients. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">69.</span><span class="ttctext">Military men have a saying: "I do not presume to act as master, I act as guest I do not presume to advance an inch, I retreat a foot." 
This is like "going forward without going forward rolling up the sleeves but baring no arm attacking without showing hostility drawing with no sword." 
Nothing brings greater disaster than the motto: "The enemy is nothing." Thinking, "the enemy is nothing": close to losing my Treasure. 
Yes, when they cross weapons and attack each other the one in mourning will win. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">70.</span><span class="ttctext">My words are very easy to understand, very easy to practice. No one in the world can understand, No one can practice them. 
The words have an ancestor the practice has a master. They just do not understand and so they do not understand me. (So few understand me - a rare treasure indeed.) 
And so the Wise Person: Dressed in shabby clothes, jade under his shirt. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">71.</span><span class="ttctext">"Aware but not aware of it: a high thing." Not aware but aware of it: sick of this. Simply sick of the sickness - and so no longer sick. 
The Wise Person's lack of this sickness: He became sick of being sick, and so he's no longer sick. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">72.</span><span class="ttctext">When the people are not in awe of your majesty then great majesty has been achieved. 
Do not restrict where they can live do not tire them out by taxing what they live on. Simply do not tire them and they will not tire of you. 
And so, the Wise Person: Knows himself does not make a show of himself. Loves himself does not exalt himself. Yes, he leaves 'that' aside, and attends to 'this.' 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">73.</span><span class="ttctext">"One who shows bravery by being daring will get killed one who shows bravery by not being daring will survive.' 
But in both these cases: "Sometimes it helps, sometimes it harms." "What Heaven picks to hate - who knows the reason?" And so the Wise Person: Treats things as difficult. 
Heaven's Way: Not contending, but excels at overcoming not speaking, but excels in getting answers not summoning, but people come of themselves lax, but excels at organization. 
Heaven's net is very wide - loosely woven, but it lets nothing slip by. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">74.</span><span class="ttctext">"The people are always lacking in the fear of death." Then why frighten them with death? 
Supposing the people always had the fear of death, and we could catch law breakers and kill them - who would dare? 
There is always The Executioner - he does the killing. Doing the killing in The Executioner's place, this is like "doing the cutting in the master carpenter's place." One who cuts in the master carpenter's place - seldom it is he does not cut his hand. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">75.</span><span class="ttctext">'The people are starving.' It is because those high up eat too much tax grain, this is why they are starving. 
'The people are hard to govern.' It is because there is Working among those high up, this is why they are hard to govern. 
'The people take death lightly.' It is because they pursue a lavish life, this is why they take death lightly. Simply: Those who do not Work at 'living' - these are better men than those who 'love life.' 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">76.</span><span class="ttctext">People begin life Soft and Weak when they are dead they are hard and firm. 
Among the thousands of things: Grass and trees begin life Soft and tender when they are dead they are withered and brittle. 
Yes, strength and hardness accompany death Softness and Weakness accompany life. 
And so: With a battle axe too hardened, you cannot win when a tree becomes hard, then comes the axe. 
The strong and the great stand lowest the Soft and Weak stand highest. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">77.</span><span class="ttctext">Heaven's Way is like the stringing of a bow: It pulls down what is high it lifts up what is low it takes away from what has an abundance to give to what has not enough. 
Heaven's Way: Take away from what has an abundance help along what has not enough. People's way is not like this: Take away from what has not enough to offer it to what has an abundance. 
Who can have an abundance to offer the world? Only the one who has Tao. 
And so the Wise Person: Works but does not rely on this achieves successes but does not dwell in them has no desire to show off his worth. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">78.</span><span class="ttctext">Nothing in the world is Softer or Weaker than water. But when it attacks what is hard and strong none of them can win out, because they have no way of affecting it. 
Softness overcomes what is hard Weakness overcomes what is unyielding. Everyone in the world understands it no one can practice it. 
And so the Wise Person says: Taking on a state's dirt makes one lord of its earth altars taking on a state's misfortunes makes one King of the world. Right words seem the opposite. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">79.</span><span class="ttctext">"When great hostilities are smoothed over there is always some hostility left." How could this be considered good? 
And so the Wise Person: "Keeps hold of the left-hand contract tally, and doesn't make demands on others." 
One who has Te is concerned with fulfilling his contract one who does not have Te concerns himself with collecting his due. 
Heaven's Way: Not to have personal favourites, but to be invariably good to all. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">80.</span><span class="ttctext">Oh for a small country with few people! Supposing there were men with the talents of dozens and hundreds, but no one employed them. Supposing the people took death seriously, and did not travel far distances. 
Although there exist boats and carriages, they have no occasion to ride in them. Although there exist armour and weapons, they have no occasion to show them off. 
Supposing people returned to knotting cords, and using this as writing. They find their food savoury they find their clothes elegant they are content with their homes they are fond of their folkways. 
Neighbouring states are in sight of one another so they hear the sounds of each others' dogs and roosters - but people reach old age and die with no comings and goings between them. 
</span></div><div class="verse"><span class="ttctitle">81.</span><span class="ttctext">Sincere words are not elegant elegant words are not sincere. 
Excellence is not winning arguments winning arguments is not being Excellent. 
Understanding is not wide learning wide learning is not understanding. 
The Wise Person does not store up for himself. By working for others he increases what he himself possesses. By giving to others he gets increase for himself more and more. 
"Heaven's Way: to benefit and not to harm." The Way of the Wise Person: to work and not contend.
